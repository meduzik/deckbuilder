	Text styles are used to render text on your cards.
	They have the following attributes:
	
		name (required): the name of your style, must be unique across the file.
			Must consist of letters, digits and underscores and start with a letter.
			
		parent (optional): the name of the parent style.
			Any attribute you do not specify will be inherited from the parent style.
			
		font (optional): the name of the font, as the browser interprets it.
			Refer to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family
			If you need quotes inside your font name, use &quot;, like this:
				font="&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"
			Defaults to empty string (whatever your browser thinks is a good default font).
			
		size (optional): the size of the text, in pixels
			Defaults to 20.
		
		color (optional): the color of the text, as a hexidecimal number #RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA for a color with transparency.
			Defaults to black.
		
		halign (optional): horizontal alignment of the text.
			Must be one of the values 'left', 'center', 'right', or 'justify'.
			Defaults to 'left'.
			
		valign (optional): vertical alignment of the text.
			Must be one of the values 'top', 'center', 'bottom'.
			Defaults to 'top'.
			
		bold (optional): make the text bold, 'true' for yes, 'false' for no
			Defaults to 'false'
			
		italic (optional): make the text italicized, 'true' for yes, 'false' for no
			Defaults to 'false'
			
		underline (optional): underline the text, 'true' for yes, 'false' for no
			Defaults to 'false'
			
		padding (optional): space in pixels between text field border and the text.
			Use when you make your text field too tight (e.g. touching card borders) and you want to add some free space.

			If you name your inline symbol "xyz" then any occurence of @xyz in a text field will be replaced
			with your image.
			Must consist of letters, digits and underscores and start with a letter.
			
		src (required): the path of the image
			If this is a relative path, it is assumed to be relative to this xml file.
			For example, if you put your heart.png symbol file along this api.xml, then simply use "heart.png" as
			your src.
			
		offset-y (optional): for how much pixels the image should be moved up (-) or down (+).

			You can directly embed some cards data with the <card> element.
			You are free to add as many attributes as you like, but the following attributes have special meaning:
			
				count: if present and is an integer, determines the number of copies of that cards in the final deck
				
				name: if present, this will be assigned as a card name in the TTS (shows when you hover over a face up card)
				
				description: if present, this will be assigned as a card description in the TTS (shows when you hover over a face up card for a few seconds)

					access.

					The exact text on the tab in the bottom of the screen, like "Sheet1"
					
			The first line of the sheet will be interpreted as a header.

				<!--
				Using expressions.
				
				Almost every attribute in the following element can be set with a computed value, based on card's data.
				
				The expression syntax is mostly very simple and close to lua or python.
				-->
				
				<!--
				Variables.
					
				To use the value of a variable, you simply name the variable. For example, x="myx" would set the 'x' position
				of an object to the value of the "myx" variable.
				
				There are some predefined variables:
				
					card: contains all the attributes of the current card. For example, if you have this card
						
							<card text="Give **2** @heart" cost="2" id="1" tags="simple" />
							
						then
						
							"card.text" will be equal to the string "Give **2** @heart"
							"card.cost" will be equal to the string "2"
							and so on
							
					deck: contains the following attributes of the deck:
					
						width: width attribute of the deck
						
						height: height attribute of the deck
						
						name: name attribute of the deck
					
				To change the value of a variable, you use the <set-var> element:
				-->
				<set-var var="myx" value="10" />
				
				<!--
				Operators.
				
				You can use the following operators in your expression:
				
					+: adds two numbers
					-: subtracts two numbers
					*: multiplies two numbers
					/: divides two numbers
					%: computes the remainder of the first number divided by the second number
					
					=: compares two values for equality, results in either 1 (equal), or 0 (not equal)
					!=: compares two values for inequality, results in either 1 (not equal), or 0 (equal)
					LT: compares two values, results in either 1 (the first one is less than the second one), or 0 otherwise
					GT: compares two values, results in either 1 (the first one is greater than the second one), or 0 otherwise
					LE: compares two values, results in either 1 (the first one is less than or equal to the second one), or 0 otherwise
					GE: compares two values, results in either 1 (the first one is greater than or equal to the second one), or 0 otherwise
					
					and: results in 1 if both values are non-zero, and in 0 if any one value is zero
					or: results in 1 if one of the values is non-zero, and in 0 otherwise
					
				For example, the following element sets the doubledcost variable to the cost of the card multiplied by 2:
				-->
				<set-var var="doubledcost" value="card.cost * 2" />
				
				<!--
				Functions.
				
				You can use the following functions:
				
					abs(x): returns the absolute value of a number (negates negative numbers and leaves positive numbers as is)
					floor(x): rounds a number down (0.2 -> 0, 1.8 -> 1, -4.3 -> -5)
					ceil(x): rounds a number up (0.2 -> 1, 1.8 -> 2, -4.3 -> -4)
					round(x): rounds a number to the nearest whole number (0.2 -> 0, 1.8 -> 2, -4.3 -> -4)
					min(x,y): returns the smallest of two numbers
					max(x,y): returns the largest of two numbers
					
					len(x): returns the length of a list
					
					tostr(x): converts its argument to a string
					toint(x): converts its argument to an integer
					tonumber(x): converts its argument to a number
					
					words(x): splits a string into a list of strings using space as separator ('this is a string' -> ['this', 'is', 'a', 'string'])
					split(x,s): splits a string into a list of strings using custom separator ('list,of,things', ',') -> ['list', 'of', 'things'])
					join(x,s): joins a list of strings into one string using custom separator (['list', 'of', 'things'], ';') -> 'list;of;things')
					repeat(s,n): repeats a string a number of times ('test', 4 -> 'testtesttesttest')
					substring(s,b,e): extracts part of a string, starting at character b, and ending at character e (not including e)
					contains(s,n): returns 1 of a string contains another string, and 0 otherwise
					concat(s1,s2): returns a new string made from concatenation of two source strings
				-->
				
				<!--
				String substitution.
				
				When an attribute requires some string data (like card name, or text field text), your input is treated as a plain string,
				and not as an expression. To substitute an expression, you need to use the `${expression}` syntax.
				See the following element for an example.
				-->
				
				<!--
				If your card's data doesn't have the "name" attribute, you can use the following element to set it.
				-->
				<set-name value="Card #${card.id}" />
				<!--
				If your card's data doesn't have the "description" attribute, you can use the following element to set it.
				-->
				<set-description value="Costs ${card.cost} to play" />
			
				<!--
				<face> element specifies a set of instruction the tool must follow to render a face of a card.
				-->
